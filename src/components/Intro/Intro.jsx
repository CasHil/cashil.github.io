        Hi! My name's Casper Hildebrand. I am currently a Computer Science
        student at the Delft University of Technology with a specialization in
        Data Science. Next to my studies, I am also working as a software
        developer at Netcompany. My main interests lie in web development, data
        science and teaching. In my free time, I am an avid musician and chess
        player. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
