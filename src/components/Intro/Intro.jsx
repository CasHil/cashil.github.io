        I'm a curious and creative MSc. Computer Science student at Delft
        University of Technology, with a specialization in Data Science. I'm
        constantly exploring new and innovative ways to use React, Vue,
        JavaScript, and TypeScript to build beautiful and functional web
        applications. When I'm not lost in lines of code, I love to spend my
        free time making music and playing chess.
